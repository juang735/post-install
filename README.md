In the Microsoft Azure portal, I can create, manage, and monitor cloud resources like virtual machines, databases, and web apps. It provides a user-friendly interface to configure services, deploy applications, and manage security through role-based access control. You can also track usage and performance with built-in dashboards and analytics. Overall, itâ€™s a centralized place to manage your entire Azure environment.

Once my virtual machine is ready, I'll use the IP address to connect to it and ensure the firewall settings are properly configured. While Azure typically handles this automatically, it's always a good idea to double-check. From there, I can use the virtual machine just like a physical computer by running programs, browsing the web, installing software, and performing any other tasks you'd normally do on a regular machine.

I can use Internet Information Services (IIS) to host and manage websites, web applications, and services on a Windows server. It allows you to configure settings like authentication, security, and performance for your sites. IIS supports multiple web technologies such as ASP.NET, PHP, and static HTML. You can access and manage it through the IIS Manager GUI or with command-line tools like PowerShell.

When a customer says they clicked a bad link or malware, first I'll advise them to disconnect from the internet to prevent further damage. Ask them not to enter any sensitive information and to avoid clicking anything else. Then, guide them to run a full antivirus or anti-malware scan immediately. Finally, report the incident to your IT or security team for further investigation and support.
