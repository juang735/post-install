One's my virtual machine is ready, i'll would use the  IP address to connect to  VM’s and  make sure my VM's firewall settings are connected. Azure often automatically handles this for you, but it’s good to double-check. I can now use the virtual machine just like a regular computer like:

Run programs.

Browse the web.

Install software.

Do anything you would on a physical computer.
